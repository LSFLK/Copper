## Dovecot configuration file

# If you're in a hurry, see http://wiki.dovecot.org/QuickConfiguration

# "dovecot -n" command gives a clean output of the changed settings. Use it
# instead of copy&pasting this file when posting to the Dovecot mailing list.

# '#' character and everything after it is treated as comments. Extra spaces
# and tabs are ignored. If you want to use either of these explicitly, put the
# value inside quotes, eg.: key = "# char and trailing whitespace  "

# Default values are shown for each setting, it's not required to uncomment
# any of the lines.

# possible to specify multiple addresses. "*" listens in all IPv4 interfaces.
# "[::]" listens in all IPv6 interfaces, but may also listen in all IPv4
# interfaces depending on the operating system.
#
# If you want to specify ports for each service, you will need to configure
# these settings inside the protocol imap/pop3 { ... } section, so you can
# specify different ports for IMAP/POP3. For example:
#   protocol imap {
#     listen = *:10143
#     ssl_listen = *:10943
#     ..
#   }
#   protocol pop3 {

#     ..
#   }

# Disable LOGIN command and all other plaintext authentications unless
# SSL/TLS is used (LOGINDISABLED capability). Note that if the remote IP
# matches the local IP (ie. you're connecting from the same computer), the
# connection is considered secure and plaintext authentication is allowed.

# Should all IMAP and POP3 processes be killed when Dovecot master process
# shuts down. Setting this to "no" means that Dovecot can be upgraded without
# forcing existing client connections to close (although that could also be

# means that after master process has died, the client processes can't write
# to log files anymore.

#login_process_per_connection = yes

## Mailbox locations and namespaces
##

# Location for users' mailboxes. This is the same as the old default_mail_env
# setting. The default is empty, which means that Dovecot tries to find the
# mailboxes automatically. This won't work if the user doesn't have any mail
# yet, so you should explicitly tell Dovecot the full location.
#
# If you're using mbox, giving a path to the INBOX file (eg. /var/mail/%u)
# isn't enough. You'll also need to tell Dovecot where the other mailboxes are
# kept. This is called the "root mail directory", and it must be the first
# path given in the mail_location setting.
#
# There are a few special variables you can use, eg.:
#
#   %u - username
#   %n - user part in user@domain, same as %u if there's no domain
#   %d - domain part in user@domain, empty if there's no domain
#   %h - home directory
#
# See doc/wiki/Variables.txt for full list. Some examples:
#
#   mail_location = maildir:~/Maildir
#   mail_location = mbox:~/mail:INBOX=/var/mail/%u
#   mail_location = mbox:/var/mail/%d/%1n/%n:INDEX=/var/indexes/%d/%1n/%n
#
# <doc/wiki/MailLocation.txt>
#
mail_location = maildir:~/Maildir

# If you need to set multiple mailbox locations or want to change default
# namespace settings, you can do it by defining namespace sections.
# NOTE: Namespaces currently work ONLY with IMAP! POP3 and LDA currently ignore
# namespaces completely, they use only the mail_location setting.
#
# You can have private, shared and public namespaces. The only difference
# between them is how Dovecot announces them to client via NAMESPACE
# extension. Shared namespaces are meant for user-owned mailboxes which are
# shared to other users, while public namespaces are for more globally
# accessible mailboxes.
#
# REMEMBER: If you add any namespaces, the default namespace must be added
# explicitly, ie. mail_location does nothing unless you have a namespace
# without a location setting. Default namespace is simply done by having a
# namespace with empty prefix.
#namespace private {
   # Hierarchy separator to use. You should use the same separator for all
   # namespaces or some clients get confused. '/' is usually a good one.
   # The default however depends on the underlying mail storage format.

   # If namespace is hidden, it's not advertised to clients via NAMESPACE
   # extension or shown in LIST replies. This is mostly useful when converting
   # from another server with different namespaces which you want to depricate

   # prefixes "~/mail/", "~%u/mail/" and "mail/".

## Mailbox handling optimizations
##

# Space-separated list of fields to initially save into cache file. Currently
# these fields are allowed:
#
#  flags, date.sent, date.received, size.virtual, size.physical
#  mime.parts, imap.body, imap.bodystructure
#
# Different IMAP clients work in different ways, so they benefit from
# different cached fields. Some do not benefit from them at all. Caching more
# than necessary generates useless disk I/O, so you don't want to do that
# either.
#
# Dovecot attempts to automatically figure out what client wants and it keeps
# only that. However the first few times a mailbox is opened, Dovecot hasn't
# yet figured out what client needs, so it may not perform optimally. If you
# know what fields the majority of your clients need, it may be useful to set
# these fields by hand. If client doesn't actually use them, Dovecot will
# eventually drop them.
#
# Usually you should just leave this field alone. The potential benefits are
# typically unnoticeable.
#mail_cache_fields = 

# Space-separated list of fields that Dovecot should never save to cache file.
# Useful if you want to save disk space at the cost of more I/O when the fields
# needed.
#mail_never_cache_fields =

# file. This allows optimizing Dovecot's behavior to do less disk writes at
# the cost of more disk reads.
#mail_cache_min_mail_count = 0

# When IDLE command is running, mailbox is checked once in a while to see if
# there are any new mails or other changes. This setting defines the minimum
# time in seconds to wait between those checks. Dovecot can also use dnotify,
# inotify and kqueue to find out immediately when changes occur.
#mailbox_idle_check_interval = 30

# Save mails with CR+LF instead of plain LF. This makes sending those mails
# take less CPU, especially with sendfile() syscall with Linux and FreeBSD.
# But it also creates a bit more disk I/O which may just make it slower.
# Also note that if other software reads the mboxes/maildirs, they may handle
# the extra CRs wrong and cause problems.
#mail_save_crlf = no

##
## Maildir-specific settings
##

# By default LIST command returns all entries in maildir beginning with a dot.
# Enabling this option makes Dovecot return only entries which are directories.
# This is done by stat()ing each entry, so it causes more disk I/O.
# (For systems setting struct dirent->d_type, this check is free and it's
# done always regardless of this setting)

# When copying a message, do it with hard links whenever possible. This makes

#maildir_copy_with_hardlinks = no

# When copying a message, try to preserve the base filename. Only if the
# destination mailbox already contains the same name (ie. the mail is being
# copied there twice), a new name is given. The destination filename check is
# done only by looking at dovecot-uidlist file, so if something outside
# Dovecot does similar filename preserving copies, you may run into problems.
# NOTE: This setting requires maildir_copy_with_hardlinks = yes to work.
#maildir_copy_preserve_filename = no

## mbox-specific settings
##

# Which locking methods to use for locking mbox. There are four available:
#  dotlock: Create <mailbox>.lock file. This is the oldest and most NFS-safe
#           solution. If you want to use /var/mail/ like directory, the users
#           will need write access to that directory.
#  fcntl  : Use this if possible. Works with NFS too if lockd is used.
#  flock  : May not exist in all systems. Doesn't work with NFS.
#  lockf  : May not exist in all systems. Doesn't work with NFS.
#
# You can use multiple locking methods; if you do the order they're declared
# in is important to avoid deadlocks if other MTAs/MUAs are using multiple
# locking methods as well. Some operating systems don't allow using some of
# them simultaneously.

# When mbox changes unexpectedly we have to fully read it to find out what
# changed. If the mbox is large this can take a long time. Since the change
# is usually just a newly appended mail, it'd be faster to simply read the
# new mails. If this setting is enabled, Dovecot does this but still safely
# fallbacks to re-reading the whole mbox file whenever something in mbox isn't
# how it's expected to be. The only real downside to this setting is that if
# some other MUA changes message flags, Dovecot doesn't notice it immediately.
# Note that a full sync is done with SELECT, EXAMINE, EXPUNGE and CHECK 
# commands.
#mbox_dirty_syncs = yes

# Like mbox_dirty_syncs, but don't do full syncs even with SELECT, EXAMINE,

#mbox_very_dirty_syncs = no

# Delay writing mbox headers until doing a full write sync (EXPUNGE and CHECK

# where clients often delete all mails. The downside is that our changes
# aren't immediately visible to other MUAs.

  # <doc/wiki/PasswordDatabase.txt>
  #
  # By adding master=yes setting inside a passdb you make the passdb a list
  # of "master users", who can log in as anyone else. Unless you're using PAM,
  # you probably still want the destination user to be looked up from passdb
  # that it really exists. This can be done by adding pass=yes setting to the
  # master passdb. <doc/wiki/Authentication.MasterUsers.txt>

  # Users can be temporarily disabled by adding a passdb with deny=yes.
  # If the user is found from that database, authentication will fail.
  # The deny passdb should always be specified before others, so it gets
  # checked first. Here's an example:

  #passdb passwd-file {
    # File contains a list of usernames, one per line
    #args = /etc/dovecot.deny
    #deny = yes

  # PAM authentication. Preferred nowadays by most systems. 
  # Note that PAM can only be used to verify if user's password is correct,
  # so it can't be used as userdb. If you don't want to use a separate user
  # database (passwd usually), you can use static userdb.
  # REMEMBER: You'll need /etc/pam.d/dovecot file created for PAM
  # authentication to actually work. <doc/wiki/PasswordDatabase.PAM.txt>

    # Setting blocking=yes uses the alternative way: dovecot-auth worker
    # processes do the PAM lookups.
    #
    # session=yes makes Dovecot open and immediately close PAM session. Some
    # PAM plugins need this to work, such as pam_mkhomedir.
    #
    # setcred=yes makes Dovecot establish PAM credentials if some PAM plugins
    # need that. They aren't ever deleted though, so this isn't enabled by
    # default.
    #
    # cache_key can be used to enable authentication caching for PAM
    # (auth_cache_size also needs to be set). It isn't enabled by default
    # because PAM modules can do all kinds of checks besides checking password,
    # such as checking IP address. Dovecot can't know about these checks
    # without some help. cache_key is simply a list of variables (see
    # doc/wiki/Variables.txt) which must match for the cached data to be used.
    # Here are some examples:
    #   %u - Username must match. Probably sufficient for most uses.
    #   %u%r - Username and remote IP address must match.
    #   %u%s - Username and service (ie. IMAP, POP3) must match.
    # 
    # If service name is "*", it means the authenticating service name
    # is used, eg. pop3 or imap (/etc/pam.d/pop3, /etc/pam.d/imap).

  #   fs: Read-only support for filesystem quota
  #quota = maildir

  # ACL plugin. vfile backend reads ACLs from "dovecot-acl" file from maildir
  # directory. You can also optionally give a global ACL directory path where
  # ACLs are applied to all users' mailboxes. The global ACL directory contains
  # one file for each mailbox, eg. INBOX or sub.mailbox.

  # Mails are first deleted in lowest -> highest priority number order
  #trash = /etc/dovecot-trash.conf

  # Lazy expunge plugin. Currently works only with maildirs. When a user
  # expunges mails, the mails are moved to a mailbox in another namespace
  # (1st). When a mailbox is deleted, the mailbox is moved to another namespace
  # (2nd) as well. Also if the deleted mailbox had any expunged messages,
  # they're moved to a 3rd namespace. The mails won't be counted in quota,
  # and they're not deleted automatically (use a cronjob or something).
