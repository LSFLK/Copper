The PHPBB3 module will integrate PhpBB3 into Group-Office. When a Group-Office user 
goes to phpbb3 it will automatically copy the user and log the user in.

Installation instructions:

1. Install phpbb3 anywhere you like as long as it is on the same server. 
   Make sure the admin username matches the Group-Office admin username 
   otherwise you won't be able to administrate phpbb3 after you are done.
   
2. Configure the URL to phpbb3 in config.php: 
	
	 $config['phpbb3_url']='http://example.com/forum/';
	
	 mind the trailing slash.
	 
3. Copy the file modules/phpbb3/auth_groupoffice.php to phpbb_root/includes/auth/auth_groupoffice.php

4. Login to the admin control panel of phpbb3 and go to:
   General -> Client communication -> Authentication 
   Select authtype Groupoffice, fill in the Group-Office database paramaters and save the settings.
   
5. Login to Group-Office as admin and install the phpbb3 module. Refresh and have fun!
