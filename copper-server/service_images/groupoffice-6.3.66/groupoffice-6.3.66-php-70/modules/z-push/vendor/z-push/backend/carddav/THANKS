*Drenalina SRL (www.drenalina.com)* sponsored the development of the following features in the BackendCardDAV, any existing bug it's my fault not theirs ;-)
Thank you very much for helping to improve it!!


 - Autodetecting addressbooks within a DAV principal.
 - Merging multiple addressbooks so the device will see a unique one. Only iOS based devices support multiple addressbooks, so we will merge them for now.
 - Selecting default addressbook to store new contacts created from the device.
 - GAL addressbook and GAL search.
