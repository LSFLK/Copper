Z-Push Trademark Policy


The word mark "Z-PUSH" (United States registered trademark 4196338) is owned
by Zarafa BV of the Netherlands. Under certain laws, Zarafa also may have
unregistered common law rights to this mark. We (Zarafa) use this mark to
promote and market this software (Z-Push). With regards to using this mark,
we provide the following trademark license.


Introduction

As we wish to encourage adoption of this software by the free software
community, we have drafted this trademark policy to ensure trademark law does
not block legitimate use of the software or the mark we apply to the software.
We have based our policy on the policy of The Document Foundation.

Our goal is to encourage widespread use of our mark by the community while
controlling that use in order to avoid confusion on the part of software users
and the general public, to maintain the value of the image and reputation of
the mark and to protect it from inappropriate or unauthorized use.

Any potential interpretation of this policy that contradicts this goal should be
regarded as a bug. Please let us know so we can fix this policy. The same
applies if a scenario exists in which the intended use of our mark is not
covered. We welcome your feedback.


General requirements

Our policy must balance two competing interests: we need to ensure that our
mark remains a reliable indicator of quality, source, and security; and we
desire to permit all community members, software distributors, and others with
whom we work to discuss our products and to accurately describe their
affiliation with us. In creating our mark policy, we seek to clarify the uses
of our Z-Push mark we consider legitimate and the uses we do not.

Our general requirements are that your use of our mark be non-confusing and
non-disparaging.

By non-confusing, we mean that people should always know whom they are dealing
with, and where the software they are downloading comes from. Websites and
software that are not created or produced by Z-Push should not imply, either
directly or by omission, that they are. For example, such an implication may
arise if a website or software bears no names or mark other than ours, or uses
our mark as the vastly most prominent name.

By non-disparaging, we mean that, outside the bounds of fair use and similar
exceptions in copyright, trademark and related laws, you cannot use our mark
as a vehicle for defaming us or sullying our reputation.


Specific permitted and non-permitted uses

You may use our mark without prior written permission (subject to the
following terms) for the following purposes:

    1. To refer to the Z-Push software in substantially unmodified form.
       "Substantially unmodified" means built from the source code provided by
       the Z-Push project, possibly with minor modifications including but not
       limited to: the enabling or disabling of certain features by default,
       translations into other languages, changes required for compatibility with
       a particular operating system distribution, the inclusion of bug-fix
       patches, or the bundling of additional fonts, templates, artwork and
       extensions.

    2. To identify Z-Push as a distinct component of a software offering.

    3. To factually refer to Z-Push itself, its products or its services.

    4. To identify Z-Push as a dependency or necessary component of other software,

    5. When referring to Z-Push software that is not substantially unmodified,
       to say that such software is a "derivative of" or "based on" Z-Push.

    6. More generally, to comply with any requirement of the GNU Affero GPL
       version 3.

    7. As part of the name of a product or service designed to work with Z-Push,
       e.g. as in "Bob's add-ons for Z-Push" or "Bob's forum for Z-Push users",
       so long as the name as a whole (via its other components) clearly and
       unambiguously distinguishes the product from Z-Push, and the general
       presentation of the product does not imply any official association or
       identity with Z-Push.

You may not use our mark in the following ways:

    1. In any way likely to cause confusion as to the identity of Z-Push, the
       origin of its software, or the software's license;

    2. In any way that indicates a greater degree of association between you
       and Z-Push than actually exists;

    3. In any way that implies a designated successor to our software (e.g.,
       "Z-Push++" or "Z-Push 2020" are not permitted).

    4. In any way that indicates that Z-Push favors one distribution, platform,
       product, etc. over another.


Additional requirements for marketing

We encourage the use of our mark in marketing, and other publicity materials
related to Z-Push. Of course, any use of our mark is subject to the overarching
requirement that its use be non-confusing.

We have three specific requirements:

    1. Proper Form: Our mark should be used in its exact form, neither
       abbreviated nor combined with any other word or words. For the logo, you
       can download copies in various formats on our website.

    2. Symbol: If reasonably possible, the first or most prominent mention of
       our registered Z-Push mark should be accompanied by a symbol indicating
       that the mark is a registered trademark ("Â®").

    3. Distinguishable: In at least the first reference, the mark should be set
       apart from surrounding text, either by capitalizing it or by italicizing,
       bolding or underlining it. In addition, a website may not copy the look
       and feel of our websites. We do not want the visitor to your websites
       to be confused about which entity he/she is dealing with.

The second and third requirements are waived in all contexts where such a mark
is not normally included: email, on-line discussion, non-graphical
advertisements (when permitted), and academic papers. We encourage the use of
the symbol whenever possible, but recognize that many non-commercial and
informal uses will omit it.


Additional requirements for merchandise using our mark

You may create and sell merchandise using the Z-Push mark without additional
permission provided that you use only unmodified graphics from the logo page on
our website. Please contact us if you would like to sell any other merchandise
containing the Z-Push mark.


Additional requirements for services related to our software

If you offer services primarily related to our software (such as support), you
may use our mark in describing and advertising your services relating to one
of our products, so long as you do not violate the guidelines for the use of
our mark or do anything that might mislead customers into thinking that either
your website, service, or product is an official Z-Push website, service, or
product, or that Z-Push has any direct relationship with your organization.


Miscellaneous provisions

We reserve the right to:

    1. Determine compliance with this policy.

    2. Modify this policy in ways consistent with its mission of protecting the
       public, the community and the users, but always within the goal
       mentioned above.

    3. Grant exceptions to this policy, of any kind and for any reason
       whatsoever, other clauses notwithstanding.


If you have questions about using our mark, or if you think you should be able
to use our mark for any purpose not allowed by this policy and would like
permission for that use, or for more information concerning our label program,
please contact us by emailing trademarks@zarafa.com (non-public).
