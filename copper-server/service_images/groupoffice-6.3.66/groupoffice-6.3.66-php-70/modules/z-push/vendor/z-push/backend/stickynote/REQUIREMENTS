REQUIREMENTS:
1. php-pgsql module

2. An active Postgres server v9.0 or above (developed on 9.6.2; v9.6+ 
recommended) either on the local machine (preferred) or accessible via 
the network.  Note that if the connection is remote performance may 
be impaired and security implications come into play; see Postgres' 
documentation.

===============================================================
This backend does ZERO authentication of credentials.  With Z-Push the
Logon process requires that ALL provided backends in the "combined" backend
succeed, so it is IMPERATIVE that AT LEAST one other back end be defined that
actually checks passwords.  THIS IS NOT A BACKEND THAT CAN BE RUN STANDALONE 
AS IT IMPLEMENTS NO SECURITY ON ITS OWN.

This is a design decision as not providing internal authentication removes 
the need for a privileged (SUID root) "helper" application, OR hijacking 
the IMAP server's authentication to check passwords.  However, it thus relies
on at least one other backend (IMAP, CalDav or Carddav) to implement same.

INSTALL:

Create the postgres role account you intend to use ("stickynote" is what's
in the config files) and grant it login permission.

Edit the create-sticky-tables.sql file to make sure the proper permissions
are set in the GRANT statements (the role account you create and permit
to sign in), editing as required.

You must make sure that the connection parameters you intend to use for
Postgres are in accord with what you set up in the config.php file for
the hostname (or IP), along with the role and password (if required) for 
access to the database.  Note that if a password is not required setting 
one will not hurt (it's ignored if not required for the given role and
connection.)

Once you have edited the create-sticky-tables.sql file, create the 
database and schemas with the following command as the Postgres superuser
(usually psql):

createdb stickynote
psql stickynote <create-sticky-tables.sql

Then edit config.php (REQUIRED; it will NOT run without modification) 
as necessary to fit and activate it in the combined backend.
