The filesearch module uses some command line programs for file indexing.

Make sure the following commands are executable:

catdoc
xls2csv
unzip
tar
imagemagick
pdf2text
pdfinfo
tesseract-ocr
exiv2

Also make sure PHP5 has the php5-xsl extension installed.


The search index must be updated in a cron job: 

/usr/share/groupoffice/groupofficecli.php -c=/etc/groupoffice/config.php -r=filesearch/filesearch/sync

This cronjob will run every night when using the debian packages.
