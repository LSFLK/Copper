# PwnedPasswords
A library to query Troy Hunt's Pwned Passwords service to see whether or not a password has been included in a public breach.

# Requirements

 - PHP >= 7.1.3
 - ext-curl

# Installation
Installing PwnedPasswords is made easy via Composer. Just require the package using the command below, and you are ready to go.

    composer require ron-maxweb/pwned-passwords
    
# Usage
To use the library, you can do something along the lines of the following.
```php
require_once('vendor/autoload.php');

$pp = new PwnedPasswords\PwnedPasswords;

$password = '123456789';

$insecure = $pp->isInsecure($password);

var_dump($insecure);
```
The `isInsecure` method will return true if the password has been found in the PwnedPasswords API, and false if not.

If you want to build your own thresholds (Ex. display a warning if the password has been found more than once and an error if more than 5x) you can call the `isInsecure` method like below.
```php
$pp = new PwnedPasswords\PwnedPasswords;

$password = '123456789';

$insecure = $pp->isInsecure($password);

var_dump($insecure);

if($insecure) {
  $count = $pp->getCount($password);
  echo 'Oh no â€” pwned!' . "\n";
  echo sprintf('This password has been seen %d time%s before.',$count,($count > 1 ? 's' : ''));
} else {
  echo 'All good !';
}
```

By default `PwnedPasswords` uses `curl_*` to fetch result, and `file_get_contents` if the curl request fails, you can specify  the method to use like this : 

```php
$pp = new PwnedPasswords\PwnedPasswords; 

$pp->setMethod(PwnedPasswords::CURL); 

$pp->setMethod(PwnedPasswords::FILE); 
```
you can also supply the curl options.
example : 

```php

...

$options = [
  CURLOPT_CERTINFO => true,
  CURLOPT_FRESH_CONNECT => true,
  CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER => true,
  CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYSTATUS => true
];

$pp->setCurlOptions($options);

```
