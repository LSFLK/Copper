Ok, now we=E2=80=99re finally to the Postfix-specific part. What we=E2=80=
=99re essentially trying to do is a content filtering operation on the me=
ssage. We want to yank it out of the queue, and, based on the content pro=
duce a modified content and return the updated message to the mail queue =
for delivery. It is not that different from what a spam (http://www.akadi=
a.com/services/postfix_spamassassin.html) filter (https://wiki.apache.org=
/spamassassin/IntegratedSpamdInPostfix) does. There are 3 places to tap i=
nto in order to achieve the desired result (manual (http://www.postfix.or=
g/CONTENT_INSPECTION_README.html)). We will choose the after queue method=
 in order to relieve pressure on RAM and CPU, and provide the most reliab=
le service. In other words, we will add -o content_filter=3Dmy_filter opt=
ion to smtp commands, where my_filter is another config element that spec=
ifies an external shell script to which the message contents will be pass=
ed.
