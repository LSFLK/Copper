    <para>The PHP command shell lets you execute arbitrary PHP
          statements on the server. These commands are executed using
          the <code>eval()</code> function, and execute in the context
          of the current session. This shell is intended to try out
          syntax and execute some simple arbitrary code. Note that to
          get any output, you must echo or print something in your
          code fragment.</para>

    <para>The SQL query shell lets you execute arbitrary SQL
          statements on your database. These commands are executed
          against the database defined in the Horde configuration file.
          You can use this tool to do queries into
          the database, to do complicated SQL updates, deletes, etc.,
          or to do simple data collection. It sends SQL queries to the
          database directly, and will report return codes and complete
          result sets.</para>
