# Example script for adding a Maildir to a Courier-IMAP virtual mail
# hierarchy.

# The script only looks at argument 3, assuming that it 
# indicates the relative name of a maildir, such as
# "somedomain.com/peter/".

# This script should be run as the user which owns the maildirs. If 
# the script is actually run by the apache user (e.g. through PHP),
# then you could use "sudo" to grant apache the rights to run
# this script as the relevant user.
# Assume this script has been saved as
# /usr/local/bin/postfixadmin-mailbox-postcreation.sh and has been
# made executable. Now, an example /etc/sudoers line:
# apache ALL=(courier) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/postfixadmin-mailbox-postcreation.sh
# The line states that the apache user may run the script as the
# user "courier" without providing a password.


# Change this to where you keep your virtual mail users' maildirs.
